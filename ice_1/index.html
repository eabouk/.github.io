		<p>Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter (/biːˈjɒnseɪ/; born September 4, 1981)[3][4][5] is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and actress. Born and raised in Houston, Texas, Beyoncé performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child. She rose to fame in the late 1990s as lead singer of the RnB girl-group Destiny's Child. Managed by her father, Mathew Knowles, the group became one of the world's best-selling girl groups in history. Their hiatus saw Beyoncé's theatrical film debut in Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002) and the release of her debut album, Dangerously in Love (2003). The album established her as a solo artist worldwide, earned five Grammy Awards, and featured the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles "Crazy in Love" and "Baby Boy".</p>


		<p>Mariah Carey (born March 27, 1969 or 1970)[3] is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, and actress. After signing to Columbia Records, she released her debut album, Mariah Carey (1990), which spawned four number-one singles on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart; "Vision of Love", "Love Takes Time", "Someday", and "I Don't Wanna Cry". Following her marriage to Sony Music head Tommy Mottola, Carey became the label's highest-selling act with the albums Music Box (1993), Merry Christmas (1994), and Daydream (1995). These albums spawned a string of successful singles, including the holiday track "All I Want for Christmas Is You" as well as "One Sweet Day", which became the longest-running U.S. number-one single in history with a total of 16 weeks. After divorcing Mottola, Carey adopted a new image and traversed towards hip hop with the release of Butterfly (1997). Billboard named her the most successful artist of the 1990s in the United States, while World Music Awards honored as the world's best-selling recording artist of the 1990s.</p>
